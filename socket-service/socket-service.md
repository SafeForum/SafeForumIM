# socket-service: is a microservice that  consists of several classes related to a socket service in a Java Spring Boot application. Here's a brief overview of each class:

1.  `SocketServiceApplication` : This class serves as the entry point of the application. It starts the Spring Boot application by calling  `SpringApplication.run()` .

2.  `SocketServiceConfig` : This class is a configuration class annotated with  `@Configuration`  and  `@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker` . It configures the message broker and WebSocket endpoints using the  `WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer`  interface. point your browser to "http://localhost:8080/profile" after running the "|>" button.

3.  `SocketServiceController` : This class is annotated with  `@Controller`  and handles WebSocket messages. It has a  `handleMessage()`  method that receives messages sent to the "/message" destination and sends the processed message to the "/topic/messages" destination. The  `SocketServiceController`  also uses a  `SocketServiceRepository`  to save the received messages.

4.  `SocketServiceRepository` : This class is annotated with  `@Repository`  and defines the interface for the repository that handles data storage. It does not contain any method declarations in the provided code.

These classes work together to create a socket service that handles incoming messages, processes them, and saves them using a repository.

The js files in `socket-service/src/main/resources/static` directory are just samples. Replace  'ws://your-websocket-server-url'  with the actual WebSocket server URL that you want to connect to.

This JavaScript code establishes a WebSocket connection, listens for incoming messages, and sends messages to the server using the  socket.send()  method.
